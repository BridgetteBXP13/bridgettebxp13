# My Repositories:

## NLP:
The full portfolio can be found [here](https://github.com/BridgetteBXP13/NLP).
In this repo, I did a lot of text processing with Python and implemented multiple NLP techniques. Such as utilizing NLTK to manage tokens/lemmas to develope a word guessing game. I also experimented with WordNet to make use of synsets and SentiWordNet to calculate polarity scores in sentences. Developed software which used Ngrams and LaPlace probabilities to predict the language of a sentence. Implemented a recusive Web Crawler to skim news articles and then created a knowledge base out of them. Overviewed different ways of syntax parsing. Utilized Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Logisitic Regression, and Neural Networks to predict the true author from a given text. Developed a debating Chatbot using Distilbert, this one is a bit special with it's own repo!

## NLP-Tera-Parish
This repo is nearly identical to mine as we worked as partners in most of our NLP class.

## Snake Debate Bot
The full portfolio can be found [here](https://bridgettebxp13/Snake-Debate-Bot/).
This repo holds the Snake Debate Chatbot, which is a chatbot that utilizes Python Flask and a finetuned Distilbert model with Tensorflow to respond correctly to the user with 50 topics and handwritten responses based on the predicted category.

## Machine Learning
The full portfolio can be found [here](https://bridgettebxp13/Machine-Learning/).
In this repo I utilized R notebooks in RStudio to create many machine learning models. I also created Naive Bayes and Linear Regression from scratch in C++. As well as utilized Python with Google Collab and Jupyter Notebook to further explore different models, neural networks, and deeplearning.

## Web_Class
This repository holds some simple markdown websites I used as homework for students I teach on the side.

## Library-Web-Application
This repo holds the Blue Library Manager web application. It has a backend database using MySQL with Django and Python. The frontend consists of basic HTML and CSS. This application was designed to be used by libarians and has the ability for them to add new borrowers, new books, search current books, check in/out books, search current borrowers, and search current loans. It handles all of the database in the background allowing them to focus on their current job/task. This application also has multiple security features and automatically updates fines/loans as needed. 

## PA1
This repo holds a simple program I wrote for my C/Unix class, it will parse a url given by the user. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/BridgetteBXP13/PA1).

## PA2
This repo holds two simple programs I wrote for my C/Unix class, it has two main parts. filecnt.c will count the files (and their total bytes) given a directory path by using recursion and the filedisp.c program. filedisp.c recieve input from the user and work along filecnt.c to achieve the goal mentioned above, it utilizes pipe techniques as a filter.
