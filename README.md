# My Repositories:

## NLP:
  The full portfolio can be found [here](bridgettebxp13.github.io/NLP).
  In this repo, I did a lot of text processing with Python and implemented multiple NLP techniques. Such as utilizing NLTK to manage tokens/lemmas to develope a word guessing game. I also experimented with WordNet to make use of synsets and SentiWordNet to calculate polarity scores in sentences. Developed software which used Ngrams and LaPlace probabilities to predict the language of a sentence. Implemented a recusive Web Crawler to skim news articles and then created a knowledge base out of them. Overviewed different ways of syntax parsing. Utilized Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Logisitic Regression, and Neural Networks to predict the true author from a given text. Developed a debating Chatbot using Distilbert, this one is a bit special with it's own repo!
